# MyPomodoro

# DESCRIPTION
 This is a simple Pomodoro timer application implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that helps individuals improve productivity and focus. This application breaks work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes of work/focus, separated by three five minutes short breaks and one long 15 minute break after four 25 minutes of work/focus has elapsed.
 
# KEY FEATURES

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

The application has a graphical user interface created using Tkinter, making it easy to interact with.

**Multiple Timer Modes:**

The application offers three timer modes:
Pomodoro Timer: A 25-minute work session.
Short Break Timer: A 5-minute break.
Long Break Timer: A 15-minute break (after completing four Pomodoro sessions).

**Task Input:**

Users can input tasks or notes in an entry widget.

**Start, Reset, and Skip Buttons:**

The "Start" button initiates the timer for the selected mode.
The "Reset" button resets the timer and the count of completed Pomodoros.
The "Skip" button allows the user to skip to the next timer mode.

**Pomodoro Count:**

A label displays the number of completed Pomodoros, and it increases by one after each completed Pomodoro session.
